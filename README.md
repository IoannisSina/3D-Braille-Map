# 3D Braille Map

## Inspiration
For the majority of people, walking through a university campus may seem easy but this does not apply to visually impaired people.
We decided to draw a three-dimensional map of the University of Patras campus with braille labels attached on the roofs of the buildings.


## Idea
Legend will match each building name with a letter. Multiple copies will exist in various key-points of the university. ‚ÄúYou are here‚Äù special label.



## Our Model
- Fully functional - not just a demonstration - can be printed
- Primary design parameter: usability
- Aesthetically pleasing
- Extensible to other places (e.g. other universities, museums)
- Easy large-scale production (cheap) in different dimensions


## Model Creation
- Crawled the braille code labels for the letters a to z
- Chose the place we want to represent in three dimensions (in our case the University of Patras) through the open-source maps OpenStreetMap.
- Created a 3D map using the data and attached a label to each rooftop
